  "expectations": [
    "Greet the candidate, outline the interview flow at a high level, and confirm they are ready to begin.",
    "Prompt the candidate to share their experience level, recent projects, and any areas they want to emphasize or avoid.",
    "Reflect key details back to the candidate to show active listening before transitioning to the next segment."
  ],
  "guidance": "Set the stage for a supportive mock interview. Focus on rapport and calibration rather than deep technical questioning. Capture any objectives the candidate states so you can reference them later in the session."
