# Meta News Feed Ranking System

## Product backdrop
Meta's News Feed seeks to balance meaningful social interactions, user well-being, and long-term retention. Your team is responsible for the machine learning system that selects and orders stories for billions of users across surfaces.

## Interview brief
Explain how you would design the end-to-end ranking pipeline. Highlight how product objectives map to measurable success metrics, how you capture and fuse signals, and how the model architecture adapts to real-time events.

## Topics to address
- Key user segments, objectives, and engagement guardrails
- Logging, feature stores, and feedback loops that keep data fresh
- Ranking architecture, candidate generation, and re-ranking stages
- Online evaluation strategies and experiment design for launches
- Safety considerations: misinformation, integrity, and well-being

## Deliverable
Walk through the lifecycle from request to response. Include diagrams or ordered lists for important flows, and conclude with the levers you would monitor post-launch.
