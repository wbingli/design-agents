# Meta Cold Start & Onboarding

## Product backdrop
The first hour a user spends in the Meta app sets the tone for long-term retention. Your charter is to create an onboarding experience that keeps new users engaged even when the graph has minimal signal.

## Interview brief
Design the systems and policies that personalize the feed when the candidate has no history. Focus on how you bootstrap signal, gather explicit preferences, and ensure quality content within minutes of sign-up.

## Topics to address
- User understanding with minimal behavioral data
- On-device heuristics, social graph seeding, and exploration tactics
- Progressive profiling flows that inform ranking quickly
- Cold-start model architectures and multi-armed bandit strategies
- Measuring success and mitigating negative experiences or spam

## Deliverable
Lay out a phased plan that covers immediate onboarding, day-one retention, and week-one personalization. Call out the feedback loops that will improve the experience over time.
